# About this project

This project is used for opening issues of self-debugged VP based on Gaboros/VenturePlan in Jul.14th which is no longer available.

These issues are self-used and help to fix some sim errors of the original addon

It will not provide any source code of the original addon

# How to find sim errors which are different to the real logs?

The original addon runs a sim and reports the real log when player finish a mission

So what I need to do is to log the sim steps and to compare the checkpoints(like hp of all units) each turn

If there is a mismatch between the sim and the real log,I report the sim steps and the real log to help check the differences
